- maxIterationCount (default: 40) - maximum number of iterations  - min: 0 - max: 2147483647

DifferentialTransformationChecker
This checker stops the ICP loop when the relative motions (i.e. abs(currentIter - lastIter)) of rotation and translation components are below a fix thresholds. This allows to stop the iteration when the point cloud is stabilized. Smoothing can be applied to avoid oscillations. Inspired by [7].
- minDiffRotErr (default: 0.001) - threshold for rotation error (radian) - min: 0. - max: 6.2831854
- minDiffTransErr (default: 0.001) - threshold for translation error - min: 0. - max: inf
- smoothLength (default: 3) - number of iterations over which to average the differencial error - min: 0 - max: 2147483647


* Inspector *

NullInspector
Does nothing.

PerformanceInspector
Keep statistics on performance.
- baseFileName (default: ) - base file name for the statistics files (if empty, disabled)
- dumpPerfOnExit (default: 0) - dump performance statistics to stderr on exit
- dumpStats (default: 0) - dump the statistics on first and last step

VTKFileInspector
Dump the different steps into VTK files.
- baseFileName (default: point-matcher-output) - base file name for the VTK files 
- dumpPerfOnExit (default: 0) - dump performance statistics to stderr on exit
- dumpStats (default: 0) - dump the statistics on first and last step
- dumpIterationInfo (default: 0) - dump iteration info
- dumpDataLinks (default: 0) - dump data links at each iteration
- dumpReading (default: 0) - dump the reading cloud at each iteration
- dumpReference (default: 0) - dump the reference cloud at each iteration
- writeBinary (default: 0) - write binary VTK files


* Logger *

FileLogger
Log using std::stream.
- infoFileName (default: ) - name of the file to output infos to, or an empty string to output infos to the standard output stream
- warningFileName (default: ) - name of the file to output warnings to, or an empty string to output warnings to the standard error stream
- displayLocation (default: 0) - display the location of message in source code

NullLogger
Does not log anything.
